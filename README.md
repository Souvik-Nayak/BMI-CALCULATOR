BMI is a measurement of a person's leanness or corpulence based on their height and weight, and is intended to quantify tissue mass.
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.
BMI can be used to screen for weight categories that may lead to health problems but it is not diagnostic of the body fatness or health of an individual.


This is a small sample project I've done in partnership with my friend and college mate ADITYA PRASAD MISHRA !
